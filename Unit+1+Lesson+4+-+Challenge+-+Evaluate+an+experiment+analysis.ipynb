    "A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.\n",

During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.\n",

    "To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.\n",

Could outliers have distorted the mean of each group grades? Also, if the plan was to discard one of these and the teacher is the subject matter expert then could be that the faith of group B was already determined in advance.  \n"
